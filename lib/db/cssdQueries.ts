/**
 * Every SQL statement the dashboard runs against the CSSD database.
 *
 * ── How the real CSSD schema works (confirmed from a database export the
 *    hospital provided, 2026-11) ──
 *
 *  SupplyTb holds two kinds of dispense rows:
 *   1. Barcoded packs (instrument sets): PackTbNo → a real PackTb row,
 *      SuplyCount = 1, and PackTb.SetTbId = SupplyTb.SetTbId.
 *   2. Consumables (สำลี, ผ้าก๊อซ, ...; SetTbId 5001+): PackTbNo = 0, a
 *      placeholder pack with no set/expiry, and SuplyCount = the quantity
 *      handed out (often more than 1).
 *  So:
 *   - item       = SupplyTb.SetTbId (NOT PackTb.SetTbId — that's NULL for
 *                  consumables); name = SetTb.SetTbName2 (SetTbName1 is a code)
 *   - quantity   = SUM(SuplyCount)
 *   - unit price = SetTb.SetTbPrice; for sets since deleted from SetTb, the
 *                  price stamped on the pack (PackTb.SetTbPrice) instead
 *   - expiry     = PackTb.SetTbExpireDate (consumables have none)
 *   - department = SupplyTb.DepartTbId → DepartTb.DepartTbName
 *
 *  Note: the hospital's own dbo.fn_Report_Aggregate counts dispenses as
 *  COUNT(PackTb rows) grouped by PackTb.SetTbId, which lumps every consumable
 *  into set 0 and counts rows instead of quantity. We deliberately differ
 *  there; barcoded-pack totals agree with it.
 *
 *  Still unconfirmed with the hospital: whether SUM(SuplyCount) is the
 *  number they want for consumables, and what to call sets that no longer
 *  exist in SetTb (their names are gone; only the ids remain).
 *
 * ── Ground rule: the CSSD program must never notice the dashboard ──
 *  Everything here is a SELECT. The login must be read-only (client.ts
 *  refuses one that can write), and every table is read WITH (NOLOCK) so the
 *  dashboard takes no shared locks: it can't hold up the CSSD program's own
 *  inserts and updates, and never waits behind them either. The trade-off —
 *  a row that is mid-insert can be counted a moment early — doesn't matter
 *  for monthly statistics.
